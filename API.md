## Broadcast messages

### supervisor message
Sent to all supervisor clients. Indicates that the supervisor need to deal with a student. The server should remove the student from the queue at the same time, and switch supervisor's status to *occupied*. 

Sent by: server
Topic: *\<name of supervisor\>*

```
{
    "ticket": <index>,
    "name": "<name>"
}
```

### Queue status
Sent to all clients in response to any changes in the queue, for example new clients entering the queue or students receiving supervision. The queue status is an ordered array of Queue tickets, where the first element represent the first student in the queue.

Sent by: server
Topic: *queue*

```
[ 
    {"ticket": <index>, "name": "<name>"}, ... 
]
```

### Supervisor status
Sent to all clients in response to any changes in the list of supervisors, for example new supervisors connecting or when the status of a supervisor changes.

Sent by: server
Topic: *supervisors*

```
[ 
    {"name": <name>, "status": "pending"|"available"|"occupied", "client": undefined|{"ticket":<index>,"name":"<name>"}}, ... 
]
```

### User messages
The server will also publish messages directly to individual users (students). These messages should received by all clients representing that user. These messages are typically indicating that it's the user's turn to receive supervision, with instructions on how/where to find the supervisor.

Sent by: server
Topic: *\<name of user\>*

```
{
    "supervisor":"<name of supervisor>",
    "message":"<message from supervisor>"
}
```
